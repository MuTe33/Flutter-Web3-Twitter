# Flutter & Web3 Wave Portal

A web3 Wave Portal using Flutter as Frontend and Solidity as Backend 

## 🏗 Structure

The smart_contract folder consists oof everything it needs to run and deploy a smart contract. The
smart contract used in this example is also in there right under `smart_contract/contracts`. More info
on that in `smart_contract/README.md`.

## 💙 Purpose

This project demonstrate core principles of a decentralized app (dApp) that is reading, writing 
from/to the blockchain and listen for event. 

## 🐵 What to expect

This project is a couple of days hack, use this as a building block or to get the gist. Many stuff is
missing here. 

- not all error cases covered
- for web I use a different web3 package then for mobile. They are not compatible
- wallet connect feature not exhaustive 
- mobile app is lacking wallet connect feature
- desktop is missing 
- UI could be way better 🥲
  
So far only web works fully. Refer to hosted side here: [Wave Portal](https://wave-portal-5.firebaseapp.com)

My goal is to add wallet connect to mobile and expand to desktop as well.

## Some Notes

- You need a API key from [Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/). These
are providing nodes which we are using to access the blockchain
- To make some transactions you can get some free ETH for the rinkeby test network here:
  1) https://faucet.rinkeby.io/
  2) https://app.mycrypto.com/add-account
